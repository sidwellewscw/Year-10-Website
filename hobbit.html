    <h4>The Hobbit</h4>
    <p> The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien, is a exciting novel set in the
    fantasy world of Middle Earth. It centres around the hobbit
    Biblo Baggins, who goes on an adventure with Gandalf the wizard
    and 13 dwarves. This is a great book for people who are just
    getting into the fantasy genre. This book is a prequel to the
    bestselling series The Lord Of The Rings (make sure you read
    the Hobbit before the main series, the Hobbit has lots of useful
    information that you need).
