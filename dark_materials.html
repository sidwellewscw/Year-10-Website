    <h4>His Dark Materials, by Phillip Pullman</h4>
    <p>His Dark Materials by Phillip Pullman is a three book fantasy
    science series. It centeres around a young girl Lyra and her
    daemon, Pantalaimon, who live among scholars at Jordan College.
    She is gifted an 'alethiometer', a future-fortelling compass.
    When her friend Roger is kidnapped, she travels to Svalbard
    with Gypsies and ends up visiting several parallel worlds. In
    the following book, the second main character, Will Parry, is
    introducd. This series is based in a fictional world, however
    it has many similarities to our own world. The books have enough
    fantasy to entertain anyone, but also includes elements of science.
    Note: The first book in the series, The Northern Lights, is also
    published under the name The Golden Compass.</p>
