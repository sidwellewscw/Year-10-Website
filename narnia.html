    <h4>The Chronicles of Narnia, by C.S. Lewis</h4>
    <p>The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis is a 7-book fantasy series
    that centres around four siblings; Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy.
    While staying in the country, they discover a magical woodrobe
    that is a doorway to the country Narnia. They travel through the
    wardrobe and meet lots of interesting chracters including Aslan
    the lion. The four children have many adventures over the course of
    the series, and in later books the focus shifts from these four
    children to centre on other kids.
    Note: The first book - The Magician's Nephew - Is technically the
    first book of the series, however it is not about Peter, Susuan,
    Edmund and Lucy. Readers may find it helpful to read The Lion,
    The Witch, and The Wardrobe first.</p>
